## 📚 Exploring Classification with Iris and MNIST Datasets

Welcome to this classification project! In this repository, we dive into machine learning using two classic datasets—the Iris dataset 🌸 and the MNIST dataset 🔢. This project compares the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and a Neural Network.

### 📝 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Understand dataset characteristics and visualize relationships.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train KNN, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models on the datasets and evaluate their performance.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare model accuracy and analyze which performs best for each dataset.

### 📊 Datasets

- **Iris Dataset** 🌸: A classic dataset for classification with 3 classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica) and 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
- **MNIST Dataset** 🔢: A widely-used dataset of handwritten digits with 10 classes (digits 0-9) and 28x28 pixel images.

### 🧠 Algorithms

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 👥: A simple and intuitive algorithm that classifies data points based on the nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Tree** 🌳: A model that splits data based on feature thresholds, creating branches that lead to classifications.
- **Neural Network** 🤖: A feed-forward neural network with dense layers for the MNIST digit classification.

### 📈 Results & Evaluation

Each model is evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy**: Overall performance metric.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of predictions vs. actual values.
- **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Results are plotted to visualize the performance of each model.

### 🛠️ Future Improvements

- **Additional Preprocessing**: Experiment with different feature scaling and transformation techniques.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improve model performance by optimizing hyperparameters.
- **Try More Models**: Consider using SVMs, Random Forests, or CNNs for further comparisons.
